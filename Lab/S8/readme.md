#### About the [cheat_lab8.py](/S8/cheat_lab8.py):
This scripts allows you to compile and compute automatically in multithread, then it shows the average time and MFLOPS.     
· Main program parameters you can change are __program_list__ and __N_list__                
· Note that after it ends, it does a `rm *x` to delete executables in the directory               
· To run it: `python3 cheat_lab8.py`

You can always (recommended) compile all at once with [ComandosCompilacion](/S8/ComandosCompilacion) and compare the results:                 
· Give execution permission: `chmod +x ComandosCompilacion`                    
· Run it: `./ComandosCompilacion`
